Description: SSDM is a package to map species richness and endemism based on
    stacked species distribution models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created
    using a single or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an
    SDM can yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a between-algorithm
    variance map, and can assess variable importance, algorithm accuracy, and
    between-algorithm correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing
    individual probabilities and thresholding then summing. Thresholding can be
    based on a specific evaluation metric or by drawing repeatedly from a Bernouilli
    distribution. The SSDM package also provides a user-friendly interface.
